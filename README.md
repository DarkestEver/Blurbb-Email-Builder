An HTML email generator
-----------------------

As a minimum viable product I'm building out the HTML email/editor first. Later if this shows traction I'll build user sessions and email delivery.



Planned features
================

- Inlined css
- Click an email section to edit it
- Add and remove email sections
- Loading icon in modal
- Blurred modal background
- One script for email build, export and send
- Format code for export (format text and format code modal)
- Modal close button
- Set image src to url
- Make separate directories for major site areas. E.g. Builder, resources, support
- More resources in resource page
- Create a better color palette for the color picker UI
